# freshchat
Freshchat module for gameclosure

##Note: Android module requires recyclerview, appcompat-v7 and support-vector-drawable modules.
- To avoid dex index overflow exception, jar file of appcompat-v7 (android/appcompat-v7/libs/classes.jar)
  is replaced with merged jar file for appcompatv7 and support-vector-drawable.

- Currently freshchat_sdk(v1.3.3) needs android support library version (v23.4.0)
